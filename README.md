# Global transmission suitability maps for dengue virus transmitted by Aedes aegypti from 1981 to 2019

This repository includes a collection of R Markdown documents that (1) walk through the features of the Mosquito-borne Viral Suitability Estimator (MVSE) R package that is used to estimate Index P, a climate-based measure of transmission potential of mosquito-borne viruses, and (2) provide examples of how the dataset of Index P spatiotemporal maps might be visualized and analyzed. These documents are meant to provide an overview of the methodology and application of Index P and thus facilitate the reuse and understanding of the generated global maps of dengue transmission potential. 

## Data
- **Climate-based dengue virus transmission suitability data**: Gridded spatiotemporal data of climate-based dengue virus transmission suitability from 1979 to 2022 at a time resolution of 1 month and a spatial resolution of 360 arcseconds are publicly available on figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21502614.v5).

## Contents

`MVSE_tutorial.Rmd`: This R markdown document shows some of the features of the Mosquito-borne Viral Suitability Estimator (MVSE) R package that is used to estimate Index P. 

`indexP_maps_introduction.Rmd`: This R markdown document provides examples of how the spatiotemporal maps of Index P might be analyzed and visualized. 

Details of specific R packages required for each step are described in the respective R scripts.
